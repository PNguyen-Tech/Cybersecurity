## 🏗️ System Components Breakdown

### 1. Overview of Operations
* **Primary Service Provided:** [Briefly describe what the application does, e.g., A cloud-hosted digital adoption platform.]
* **Core Commitments:** [List the main promises the company makes regarding Security, Confidentiality, and Availability.]

### 2. Infrastructure & Network Architecture
* **Cloud Provider:** [e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP]
* **Network Security Mechanisms:** [Describe how the network is protected, e.g., Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), firewalls, deny-by-default security groups.]
* **Data Flow:** [Briefly map how a user connects to the application from the internet to the internal servers.]

### 3. Software
* **Key Applications/Tools:** [List the main software components utilized, e.g., GitHub for version control, Office 365 for communication.]
* **Primary Tech Stack:** [List languages/frameworks if mentioned.]

### 4. People
* **Key Roles Identified:** [List the essential security and operational roles, e.g., Information Security Officer, Compliance Program Manager.]
* **Access Philosophy:** [Describe the overarching approach to user access, e.g., Principle of Least Privilege, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).]

### 5. Procedures
* **Critical Policies in Place:** [List 3-5 major policies mentioned, e.g., Change Management, Incident Management, Data Retention.]
* **Policy Enforcement:** [How are employees held accountable? e.g., Annual acknowledgments, security awareness training.]

### 6. Data Classification

## 🚧 System Boundaries & Shared Responsibility

### Boundaries of the Scope
* **What is Included:** [Define exactly what parts of the business are covered by this audit.]
* **What is Excluded (Vendor Risk):** [Identify what relies on third parties and how that risk is managed, e.g., relying on AWS physical security reports.]

## 💡 Key Takeaways for Cloud Compliance
[Write a short paragraph reflecting on how this system description applies to modern cloud deployments. For example, note how heavily the organization relies on automated cloud-native tools or strict version control (like GitHub) to enforce their written procedures.]
